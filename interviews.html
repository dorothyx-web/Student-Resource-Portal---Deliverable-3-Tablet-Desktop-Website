        <p>Start any interview strongly by highlighting your achievements and telling a concise, comprehensive story. TMAY (“Tell Me About Yourself”) is one of the most frequently asked questions in interviews, and it’s generally the first one posed. Your response should highlight your educational, technical, or business-related achievements.</p>
        <p>It’s expected (and reasonable) to reference materials such as your resume or cover letter. However, responses should be tailored to emphasize how you meet the organization’s needs—each interview should be slightly different.</p>
        <p>Think of this answer as an extended version of an elevator pitch and a preview of the rest of the interview. Ask yourself: What key messages do you want to convey about your ability to succeed in the role and your interest in it?</p>

          <td>Interviewers will likely speak with many candidates—remind them who you are:<br>
            • Restate your name<br>

      <h2>Program-Specific TMAY Examples with Course Projects</h2>

      <details class="accordion">
        <summary><strong>UX Design Track (Target Role: UX Design Intern)</strong></summary>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p><em>"Hi, I’m Zoe Kim — I’m a junior in UMSI’s Information Science program with a focus on UX Design, and I’m excited to share how my course projects align with your intern role."</em></p>
          <p>Last semester I took "Intro to UX Design" and worked on a client-based project for GLANSIS, a local environmental organization. Their website was outdated and hard for users to find conservation resources, so my task was to redesign the site’s information architecture and create high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
          <p>I conducted 8 user interviews to identify pain points, created personas, developed wireframes, and tested with participants. The final deliverable was a Figma prototype and 10-page design brief. The GLANSIS director said they plan to use my prototype to secure redesign funding. This project taught me how to balance user needs with client goals—a skill directly relevant to your UX Design Intern role.</p>
          <p>I’m particularly drawn to your company’s focus on accessible design. During the GLANSIS project, I ensured all text met WCAG contrast standards and added screen reader compatibility notes. I’m eager to bring this user-centric, accessible mindset to your team.</p>

        <summary><strong>Information Analysis Track (Target Role: Business Intelligence Intern)</strong></summary>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p><em>"Hello, I’m Raj Patel — I’m a senior in UMSI’s Information Analysis program, and I want to share how my course projects have prepared me for your Business Intelligence Intern role."</em></p>
          <p>This semester I’m in "Information Analysis for Organizations," where my team worked on a project for a local small business association analyzing survey data to understand why 30% of members hadn’t renewed. I led data cleaning in SQL, created Tableau visualizations (heatmaps and dashboards), and identified “lack of networking opportunities” as a top reason.</p>
          <p>We presented our findings to the board, and they approved a pilot program based on our recommendation. This project taught me how to translate raw data into business insights—exactly what your intern role entails.</p>
          <p>I’m proficient in Tableau, which your job description lists as required. My dynamic dashboards let the association filter data by business type, helping me contribute immediately to your team’s analytics projects.</p>

        <summary><strong>Data Science Track (Target Role: Data Science Intern)</strong></summary>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p><em>"Hi, I’m Liam Scott — I’m a junior in UMSI’s Data Science specialization, and I’m excited to talk about how my course projects align with your Data Science Intern role."</em></p>
          <p>In "Natural Language Processing for Health Data," I built an NLP model to classify 25,000+ tweets about medication side effects. I implemented SVM and CNN models in Python using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. After tuning, the CNN achieved an F1 score only 0.07 below expert baseline.</p>
          <p>This taught me to apply NLP to health data, aligning with your role’s focus on analyzing patient feedback. I used libraries your team also relies on and followed ethical AI practices by checking for demographic bias in training data.</p>
